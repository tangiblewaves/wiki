This micro module is a tiny, multifunctional oscillator module that offers a variety of waveforms:
* Sawtooth
* Pulse
* Triangle/Sine
* three different wavetables
It offers knobs and CV control for pitch and shape (variations of the base waveform). Additionally, it can be controlled via IMDI and supports note/pitch, pitchbend, Assignable controller for shape and pitchbend range can be set via IMDI/MIDI by the specified controller message.

This module needs to be installed on the [[AeManual/uBASE | µBASE]] module!

Module power consumption: ? mA

!!! Inputs

* '''CV''' - CV control for pitch, 1V/octave
* '''IMDI''' - IMDI messages for pitch, shape and others
* '''SHP''' - CV for controlling the shape
* '''CV2''' - additional CV input (###to be specified)

!!! Outputs

* '''OUT'''  - the audio output
* '''SO'''  - suboctave as square wave
* '''MX'''  - mix of audio out and suboctave

!!! Controls

* '''FREQ''' Pot - controls the pitch
* '''SHAPE''' Pot - modifies the selected waveform in different ways, depending on the selected waveform
* '''0 / +2''' switch - changes the pitch by 2 octaves
* '''mode''' button - cycles through the available modes / waveforms, displayed by the LED:
red: sawtooth, green: pulse, orange: triangle/sine, blinking ###EXPLAIN: wavetable 1, 2, 3

!!! Shape function
* in Sawtooth mode: full left is a single sawtooth, the further right, increasingly detuned double sawtooth
* in Pulse mode: sets the pulsewidth
* in triangle/sine mode: in the left half, triangle wave, in the right half sine wave
* in wavetable modes: scans through the wavetable waveforms
